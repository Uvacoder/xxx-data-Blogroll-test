Join us at the **White Horse** in **Leamington Spa** for a local midweek offshootof the Multipack, where you can join geeks from Leamington, Warwick, Coventry, Stratford-upon-Avon and the surrounding areas for a midweek drink, a bite to eat and a chat about all things web, geek and tech.

Every two months we combine with the iOS Midlands Meetups crowd for an added iOS and mobile development dimension.
