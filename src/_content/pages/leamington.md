Leampack met at the **White Horse** in **Leamington Spa** for a local midweek offshoot of the Multipack, where you can join geeks from Leamington, Warwick, Coventry, Stratford-upon-Avon and the surrounding areas for a midweek drink, a bite to eat and a chat about all things web, geek and tech.

Every two months we combined with the iOS Midlands Meetups crowd for an added iOS and mobile development dimension.

The Leamington meetup has changed it’s name and is now called [LeamGeeks](https://www.leamgeeks.com).
