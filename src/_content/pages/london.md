For those folk who used to work in Birmingham but can now be found in UKâ€™s capital, either occassionally or permanently. 

The first reunion is on **Thursday 5th March 2020** from 6pm at **The Marquis of Granby in Westminster**. 

A small group of the original crowd are planning to attend including [Paul](https://twitter.com/paulrobertlloyd), [Andy H](https://twitter.com/aajhiggs), [Ant](https://twitter.com/abitgone), [Matt](https://twitter.com/shuckle), [Gaz](https://twitter.com/gaznet) and [Si](https://twitter.com/Si). Many have to travel back to the Midlands afterwards so banter will likely continue along the North West Coast mainline.

Expect some tweets from [@multipack](https://twitter.com/multipack) with photos on the night and after.
