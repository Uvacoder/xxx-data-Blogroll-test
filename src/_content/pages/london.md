For those folk who used to work in Birmingham but can now be found in UKâ€™s capital, either occassionally or permanently. 

The first reunion is on **Thursday 5th March 2020** from 6pm at **The Marquis of Granby in Westminster**. 

A small group of the original crowd are planning to attend including Paul, Andy H, Ant, Matt, Gaz and Si. Many have to travel back to the Midlands afterwards so banter will likely continue along the North West Coast mainline.

Expect some tweets from @multipack with photos on the night and after.
