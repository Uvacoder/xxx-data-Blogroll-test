This month, our meeting time will be changing to 7:30pm so that you can come and join us either after work or on your way home from work. Come and grab a bite to eat and have a drink or two with us and discuss anything from web design and development, social media and the internet through to game design, multimedia and anything remotely geek-oriented!

This event sadly clashes with [The Multipack’s impromptu curry night with Leevi Graham](/events/2009/october-curry) over in Solihull; you will certainly want to make the trip to Solihull if you’re in any way interested in ExpressionEngine or CodeIgniter.
