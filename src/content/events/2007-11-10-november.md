summary: Rather than just get together to chat and drink, this time we will be using our time constructively by redesigning the Multipack website!

It’s served us well for the last 18 months or so but its time to move on to the next level and make the website a hub for all - existing members and new visitors.

We will be taking over the offices of One Black Bear in the Custard Factory for a whole day, planning tasks first thing in the morning, coding and designing through the day for a relaunch on the Monday morning (we need to test these enhancements, hence the delay in launching).

If you’re keen to attend, bring your kit (laptop or Mac) and some drink - we’ll supply some munchies and try to fit in a pub lunch at some point.
