The aim of the event is to build a Web site or app that encourages Web people like us to think about how we can reduce the size of our carbon footprint, both in the office and on the road.

The Hack Day is open to everyone and free to attend – just bring along your ideas and your laptop! The event kicks off at 10am on Saturday 20 February, with the option of running over to Sunday if necessary; you will be encouraged to go home and sleep – it’s not an all-nighter!
