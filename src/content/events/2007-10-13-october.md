summary: It’s the Multipack’s 2nd birthday! How better to celebrate this than returning to the original meeting place way back in 2005 and having a few beers/cokes.

We will also be supplying cake so if you’re a Multipack member, new or old, head down to the Wharf (next to the art gallery if you don’t know the area) and join us for a right royal knees up!
