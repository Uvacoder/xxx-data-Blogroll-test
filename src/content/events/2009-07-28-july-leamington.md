We’ll be having a few beers, and maybe something to eat, in the White Horse again and - if the weather holds up - we’ll be back outside, along with a way of identifying ourselves to new visitors and, more importantly, those who may have come last time but couldn’t find us!

Feel free to bring your colleagues, friends and contacts - in fact, anyone who is interested in the web, the internet or anything inbetween - everyone is more than welcome to come and join the discussion!
