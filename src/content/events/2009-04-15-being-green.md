We have confirmed presentations from two people extremely passionate about eco issues and have been using the Web to make life greener.

**David Harte** has been responsible for a lot of work in the Act On CO2 campaign in Birmingham and will be showing us how he and the team have been using the Internet to gauge CO2 emissions.

**James Robertson** will also be talking to us about how he set up the Birmingham Freecycle group using online resources and how he made it one of the most successful groups in the World.

Finally, Multipack resident **Paul Lloyd** will be lifting the lid on his latest project to make conferences more eco-friendly as well as intentions for other green issues around the Web.

There will also be the obligatory drinking session at nearby pub The Old Crown between 2-4pm, no doubt continued after the talks, giving you a chance to socialise with all those in attendance.
