You’ll have a chance to learn from developers of first-class apps that have been launched on the various App Stores and App Marketplaces, as well as from those who have successfully launched mobile web apps at our free mini-conference event. 

As usual, we’ll kick off with a social gathering, though as we’ve changed venue, this will be held at either The Sack Of Potatoes or Gosta Green (we’ll let you know which closer to the event) at 2pm, where you can join us for a drink and a bite to eat, before heading to our new venue for this month, Birmingham Science Park’s meeting rooms, close to Aston University’s campus, for around 4pm. More information on the event is available at [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/multipack-presents-may) - if you’re a Twitter user, please indicate your attendance there.
