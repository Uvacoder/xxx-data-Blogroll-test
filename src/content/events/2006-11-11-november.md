summary: Penultimate meetup of the year for web developers, designers, programmers, and their mates from around the Midlands. Back to the central Midlands and second city Birmingham. Regulars should know this venue quite well by now, but we could easily move to many of the bars along Broad Street, by the canal or to the Mailbox.
