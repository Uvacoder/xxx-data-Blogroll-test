Simply show us something you’ve made or have been involved in and tell us about it. We kick off with a social gathering at the Old Crown pub in Digbeth, at 2pm, where you can join us for a drink and a bite to eat, before heading to the offices of Birmingham web agency, One Black Bear, for the talks from around 4pm. 

If you’ve got something to show and tell, please head over to <http://j.mp/showtell-feb11> and propose your idea for a talk. Deadline for submissions is 11pm on Monday, January 31st and the chosen sessions will be selected by Monday, February 6th.
