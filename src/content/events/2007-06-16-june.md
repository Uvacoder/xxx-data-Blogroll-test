> A pub built in the shell of a bank. Good atmosphere and decent food. It’s a Fuller’s pub, so one of the few places in Birmingham which serves London Pride.
>
> The mezzanine overlooks the pub and serves as a quieter place to eat. The club room can be reserved for special functions at no charge, providing there are enough people. The upstairs rooms are also available for private functions, ask at the bar for prices.” — [OpenGuides Birmingham](http://birmingham.openguides.org/wiki.cgi?TheOldJoint_Stock)
