Leampack met at the **White Horse** in **Leamington Spa** for a local midweek offshoot of the Multipack. Geeks from Leamington, Warwick, Coventry, Stratford-upon-Avon and the surrounding areas met up for a midweek drink, a bite to eat and to chat about all things web, geek and tech.

Every two months this was combined with the iOS Midlands Meetups crowd for an added iOS and mobile development dimension.

The Leamington meetup still continues, and is now called [LeamGeeks](https://www.leamgeeks.com).
