summary: The West Midlands’s friendly geek community.

At its core, the Multipack was about socialising and making new friends. It was also a forum for discussion, and a network for talented web professionals all looking to bring the best of what the web has to offer, not only to their own lives and work, but to others’ as well.

The group began with the meeting of 4 web-working Midlanders – [Si Jobling](https://sijobling.com/), [Paul Lloyd](htps://paulrobertlloyd.com), [Jon Roobottom](https://roobottom.com/) and Chris Lysaght – in a bar in Walsall [back in October 2005](/events/2005/october/).

Over the following years, the Multipack often headed to the **Old Joint Stock** in **Birmingham** once a month for a drink, and optional bite to eat.
